# Stroly Utilities

This repository contains various utilities we have developed for several projects
or proofs of concept. 
They are rarely or never used in the final product [www.stroly.com](https:\\www.stroly.com).

In general they were used for a single purpose, sometimes a one-off, hence they are more 
initial points instead of final, production ready programs.

The repository is divided by the category of the script:

1. __Google OCR__: We use [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to extract the text
from images. This category includes several tools to visualize, process, or analyze the output of
the API, mainly of the OCR.
2. __Machine Learning__: Many machine learning projects are on the pipeline for Stroly. Here we include
scripts to obtain, process or visualize datasets used for Machine Learning projects.
3. __Image Processing__: Includes scripts to process images, including analysis of JPEG quality.
